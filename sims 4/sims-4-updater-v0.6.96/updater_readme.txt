=======================================================================================

Simply select your game folder and click the Update button. Sims 4 Updater uses
a mix of xdelta patches and full files to ensure as small download as possible.

=======================================================================================

If you have a legit game then Sims 4 Updater will put the cracked exe in
"The Sims 4\Game-cracked\Bin\TS4_x64.exe".
Start the cracked exe to play with all DLCs.

If you want to play your legit game with pirated DLCs then you need to use
a DLC Unlocker. You can get one from here:
https://anadius.hermietkreeft.site/dlc-unlockers
https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=104412
Use the EA DLC Unlocker v2. It's much easier to use
and much better than the Unlocker v1.

If you're looking for the instructions on how to use the
manually downloaded patches - read the FAQ below.

FAQ:

    Q: Updater doesn't run, I get some error message, what should I do?
    A: First of all Sims 4 Updater is 64-bit only, so make sure your Windows
       is 64-bit too. It's written in Python 3.10 and they dropped Windows 7
       support in 3.9, so if you have Windows 7 - update it to 8 or newer.
       And lastly make sure you have VC Redist 2015-2022 x64
       ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads )
       installed and that your anti-virus doesn't block it.

    Q: I get download errors, what should I do?
    A: You can try using a VPN, like ProtonVPN.
       If it's too slow consider downloading the files manually.
       If the Updater can't auto-update, download the newest version yourself:
       ( https://rentry.org/sims-4-updater-beta )
       If you can't update the game - first download all the patches
       between your current game version and the newest one:
       ( https://rentry.org/sims-4-updater-beta#sims-4-updater-manual-updates )
       Then download my newest crack (no-origin-fix-<game version>-ANADIUS.rar):
       ( https://rentry.org/the-sims-4-crack-only )
       And finally if you want to install some DLCs grab them from:
       ( https://rentry.org/the-sims-4-dlc-only )
       Put all downloaded files in the same folder as the Updater and simply run it.

    Q: I get some other errors, what should I do?
    A: First culprit is your anti-virus. Disable it.
       If that doesn't help reset file permissions (see question below).
       If that doesn't help copy the whole Updater ("sims-4-updater-<version>.exe",
       all "updater_*" files and "updater_tmp" folder) somewhere else.
           That's important: COPY, not move.
       If that doesn't help copy your game somewhere else.
           Again: COPY, not move.

    Q: Error message tells me to reset file permissions, how do I do it?
    A: Download this file
       ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/807968248515526726/966664187235422228/reset-folder-permissions.bat )
       Right click on it, run as administrator.

    Q: Is the new update/DLC added to the Updater?
    A: Check out my Discord or a couple of last pages from The Sims 4 thread:
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=65003 )
       I post the news about the Updater there.

    Q: Can you install the whole game with the Updater?
    A: Yes, but I don't recommend it. Use some repack from the second post of
       The Sims 4 thread instead:
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=930236#p930236 )

    Q: I updated the game but a new DLC didn't install, why?
    A: There are 3 possible reasons:
       1. That DLC isn't out yet. The Sims 4 always gets an update 2-5 days
          before the DLC comes out. The DLC may appear unlocked on the main
          menu screen but if it's not out yet then I can't do anything about
          it, I'm not a time traveller.
       2. You didn't check that DLC in the "Install DLCs" window.
       3. You use DLC Unlocker and didn't read what to do when we get a new DLC.

    Q: I have problems with starting/playing the game, where can I get some help?
    A: Make sure you read the troubleshooting guide. You can find it on my website:
       ( https://anadius.hermietkreeft.site/sims-4-troubleshooting-guide )
       It's also posted on Reddit and in the first post of The Sims 4 thread on CS RIN:
       ( https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/eskpgu/the_sims_4_troubleshooting_guide/ )
       ( https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=930232#p930232 )
       If you still have problems you can ask in The Sims 4 thread or on my Discord.
